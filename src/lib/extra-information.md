# Tips

## Reduce your waste

Replacing plastic is important but not the whole solution, as alternatives come with their own issues and impacts.  Think about:
- Using zero waste shops like Greenwise in Fetcham
- Replacing single use plastics with long-life items – such as Tupperware instead of bags and silicone stretch lids instead of cling film.
- Taking refillable coffee cups and shopping bags with you, or keeping them in your car.

## Repair first

For instance, the [FaB Repair Café](https://fetchamandbookhamrepaircafe.com/) meets on the first Saturday of every month at St. Mary’s Church Hall in Fetcham, and offers to repair a range of items for free.

## Reuse

Can you give your items a second life?  [Freecycle](https://www.freecycle.org/) is a great way to pass items you no longer want onto other people who can use them, especially if you don’t think they are worth selling.  You’d be surprised what people are willing to take if it’s free!

## Carbon footprint

Bear in mind your carbon footprint if you need to travel in order to recycle objects.
- Can you drop items off on your way to somewhere else?
- Can you walk or cycle?
- Can you collaborate with other people nearby?

## Preparing your recycling

Ensure items are clean and dry before being put out for recycling.  Tops, lids, and labels may usually be left on bottles and jars.
